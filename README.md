# Objective
Use the technique known as transfer learning to develop a model that can accurately predict the diagnosis of patients (Pneumonia/Normal) 
using Keras, and then demonstrate that using BigDL one can scale this approach and be able to fit any model like this on a much powefull cluster.

We decided to use the EfficientNet model, as is very efficient, it's optimized for image classification, and very suited for transfer learning.

# Presentation of results
In our main notebook we illustrate how an approach like this can work using the biggest version of EfficientNet. 
And on the secondary notebooks one can review the results for smaller varsions, just for comparison sake.

We were not able to work on google colab, so these results are derived from local computations.
